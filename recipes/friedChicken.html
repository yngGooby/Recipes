        <h2>Making the Breading</h2>
        <p> Combine the flour, paprika, salt, and pepper in a zip-top bag. Seal the bag and<br> shake until well-combined. </p>
        
        <h2>Dredge the Chicken</h2>
        <p> Pour buttermilk into a shallow bowl, then dip the chicken (on both sides) until<br> it's completely soaked in buttermilk. Place the soaked chicken in the bag with<br> flour mixture, seal, and shake well to coat. Transfer the coated chicken to a<br> baking sheet, and cover. Allow the flour coating to become a paste-like<br> consistency. </p>
        
        <h2>Fry the Chicken</h2>
        <p> Pour the oil in a skillet and bring it to high heat. Brown the chicken on both<br> sides, then reduce the heat, cover the skillet, and cook for about 30 minutes.<br> Remove the cover, return the heat to high, and fry until extra crispy. Drain the<br> chicken on paper towels. </p>
    
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (4 pound) chicken, cut into pieces</li>
            <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour for coating</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 quarts vegetable oil for frying</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li> Take your cut up chicken pieces and skin them if you prefer. </li>
            <li> Put the flour in a large plastic bag (let the amount of chicken you are cooking<br> dictate the amount of flour you use). Season the flour with paprika, salt and<br> pepper to taste (paprika helps to brown the chicken). </li>
            <li> Dip chicken pieces in buttermilk then, a few at a time, put them in the bag with<br> the flour, seal the bag and shake to coat well. </li>
            <li> Place the coated chicken on a cookie sheet or tray, and cover with a clean dish<br> towel or waxed paper. LET SIT UNTIL THE FLOUR IS OF A PASTE-LIKE<br> CONSISTENCY. THIS IS CRUCIAL! </li>
            <li> Fill a large skillet (cast iron is best) about 1/3 to 1/2 full with vegetable oil. Heat<br> until VERY hot. </li>
            <li> Put in as many chicken pieces as the skillet can hold. Brown the chicken in HOT<br> oil on both sides. </li>
            <li> When browned, reduce heat and cover skillet; let cook for 30 minutes (the<br> chicken will be cooked through but not crispy). Remove cover, raise heat again,<br> and continue to fry until crispy. </li>
            <li> Drain the fried chicken on paper towels. Depending on how much chicken you<br> have, you may have to fry in a few shifts. Keep the finished chicken in a slightly<br> warm oven while preparing the rest. </li>
        </ol>
