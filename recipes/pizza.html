        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Pizza on the grill is a fantastic way to make pizza at home! The heat of a hot grill is a <br> perfect match for a professional pizza oven. This grilled pizza recipe makes the dough<br> from scratch and flavors it with garlic and basil. Use your favorite variety of toppings and<br> shredded cheese, but it's best not to overload the pizza.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        
        <h3>Pizza Dough</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
            <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 pinch white sugar</li>
            <li>3 ⅓ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>pizza toppings</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>¼ cup tomato sauce, divided</li>
            <li>1 cup chopped tomatoes, divided</li>
            <li>¼ cup sliced black olives, divided</li>
            <li>¼ cup roasted red peppers, drained and chopped, divided</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh basil, divided</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li> Make dough: Pour warm water into a large bowl; dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 to 10 minutes. </li>
            <li> Mix in flour, 1 tablespoon olive oil, and salt until dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl. </li>
            <li> Turn onto a lightly floured surface. Knead until smooth, about 8 minutes. </li>
            <li> Place dough in a well-oiled bowl and cover with a damp cloth. </li>
            <li> Set aside to rise until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch down; knead in garlic and basil. Set aside to rise for 1 more hour, or until doubled again. </li>
            <li> Meanwhile, make garlic oil: Combine 1/2 cup olive oil with minced garlic in a microwave-safe cup or bowl. Heat for 30 seconds in the microwave. </li>
            <li> Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat; brush the grate with garlic oil. </li>
            <li> Make pizzas: Punch down dough and divide in half. Form each half into an oblong shape 3/8 to 1/2 inch thick. </li>
            <li> Carefully place one piece of dough on the hot grill. Dough will begin to puff almost immediately. When the bottom crust has lightly browned, turn dough over using two spatulas. </li>
            <li> Working quickly, brush garlic oil over crust. </li>
            <li> Top with 1/2 of each of the following: tomato sauce, chopped tomatoes, olives, red peppers, cheese, and basil. </li>
            <li> Close the lid and cook until cheese melts. Remove from grill and set aside to cool for a few minutes. Repeat with second piece of dough. </li>
            <li> Serve hot and enjoy! </li>
        </ol>
